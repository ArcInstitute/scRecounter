Nextflow pipeline to re-process all public single-cell data



# Installation

## Conda & mamba install

`mamba` is needed to run the pipeline. 
It is a faster version of `conda`. `mamba` can be installed via `conda`. 

To install both `conda` and `mamba`, 
see the [conda/mamba Notion docs](https://www.notion.so/arcinstitute/Conda-Mamba-8106bed9553d46cca1af4e10f486bec2).

## Nextflow install

It is easiest to install Nextflow using `mamba`:

```bash
mamba install -n nextflow_env -c bioconda nextflow
```

Make sure to activate the environment before running the pipeline:

```bash
mamba activate nextflow_env
```

## Pipeline install

### Add ssh key to GitHub

> This is only needed if you have not already added your ssh key to GitHub.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

* change `your_email@example.com` to your Arc email

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

* copy the output
* GoTo: `GitHub => Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH key`
* Paste the output into the key field
* Add a title (e.g., `Chimera`)
* Click `Add SSH key`

### Clone the repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ArcInstitute/scRecounter.git \
  && cd scRecounter
```

### Pipeline conda environments 

The pipeline uses conda environments to manage dependencies. 
Nextflow will automatically create the environments as long as `mamba` is installed.

**Note:** it can take a while to create the environments, even with `mamba`.


# Usage


```bash
nextflow run main.nf \
  -profile conda,slurm \
  -work-dir /scratch/$(id -gn)/$(whoami)/nextflow-work/scRecounter \
  --accessions
```
