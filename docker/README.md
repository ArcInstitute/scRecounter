Custom docker containers for the scRecounter pipeline
=====================================================

This directory contains the Dockerfiles for the custom docker containers used in the scRecounter pipeline. 
The containers are built on top of the official [Bioconductor docker images](https://hub.docker.com/u/bioconductor)
and contain the necessary dependencies for the pipeline to run.
